## NextJS Dashboard with Login/Signup workflow
This is all UI based no backend but I will add that after this is complete for completeness. 
For this project we are using NextJS with TypeScript, ShadCn and TailwindCSS. 
I've been tinkering around with ShadCn and must admit I'm really liking it. 

Straight to the point no nonsense stuff, along with NextJS and the use of Server Side Components make this a really amazing workflow. 
Some of the benefits that come to mind are:
- Improved Performance and SEO
- Better Data Fetching Capabilities
- Enhanced Security
- Simplified Development Workflow
- Better Developer Experience
- Scalability


This is just placeholder for now as I'll update this README when I'm done.

## Images of the Login in Light and Dark Mode
This is what the Login page will look like for both Light and Dark mode. 
What is even better though no matter how cool a layout may look is if it is accessible. 
Common problem today with many Designers is that they often forget or don't even know about accessibility. 
With a few days of training they can learn to implement accessibility early on in a project. 
Even at the most basic level this is still better than having no knowledge. Design is the first line of
defense from putting out workflows that just are a horrible experience. 

Due to how browsers interact differently, the limitations in how the workflows are tested and how the ease of use is perceived.
At the end of the day the benefits are that you make your products available to everyone, to create a truly inclusive workflow. 

Ultimately no one ever wants to have a lawsuit against them but it does happen. When these lawsuits are encountered they often
are just asking for the needed fixes. Yet there are examples where companies offer up services that don't do what they say they do. 

A great rule of thumb being that if any organization or small to medium sized company sells accessibility solutions. 
Run an accessibility audit on there site, and it it doesn't look like the images attached after the listed link. 
You must ask yourself what is really going on here. 
Here is the plugin I used to scan any site and also how I test when building out UI's.
